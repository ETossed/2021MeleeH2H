# Melee H2H and W/L Matchup Chart for (Offline) Events in 2021 by ETossed

I'm publishing the code, as well as the raw files, here so that you can take it and make your own matchup charts :)

I could have written it better (especially if pysmashgg was working fully properly) but I wasn't looking for efficiency in code, was just trying to get it done! Ask me if you have any questions at @ETosssed

One thing that will be added is losses to non-mentioned players, so that you can see bad losses of players, that will come soon hopefully. I will also update the code to add methods later.
